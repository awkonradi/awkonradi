- 👋 Hi, I’m @awkonradi, Andrei W. Konradi, a 56-year-old semi-retired medicinal chemist.
- 👀 I’m interested in Arduino with LoRaWAN for occupancy-sensing birdhouses, and perhaps later Arduino with Iridium transception for unmanned sailing craft.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of C programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking for help from anybody willing!
- 📫 I can be reached at awkonradi@yahoo.com.
